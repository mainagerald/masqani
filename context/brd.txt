This file will track business requirements and goals for the property listing and landlord-tenant portal platform. It will be updated as we refine the vision and features.

## 2025-04-21
- Platform inspired by realtor.com and redfin.com, tailored for the Kenyan market.
- User roles: Application Admin, Landlord, Tenant. No agents for now.
- Core features: property listing, advanced search/filtering (price, location, size, type, parking, pets, elevators, map/radius), landlord-tenant portal for payments (bank cards, M-Pesa), maintenance, lease management (with landlord approval), reminders, dashboards.
- Video/virtual tours: future, non-priority.
- Notifications: SMS/email initially, push (Flutter) later.
- Open registration for all users. No extra payment or property verification integrations for now.
- Priorities: Advanced filters and optimized queries, dashboards for landlords/tenants (to be implemented from scratch), payment and maintenance flows.
- Next: Analyze current backend/frontend for implementation plan.
