# Roadmap: Spring-First Automation & Agentic Extension Points

## 1. Immediate Focus: Spring-First Automation
- Use Spring Boot for all core business logic, CRUD, and simple automations.
- Implement notifications, reminders, and scheduled tasks using Spring’s built-in tools:
  - @Scheduled for periodic jobs (e.g., rent reminders, lease expiry checks)
  - Spring Events for decoupled, event-driven actions (e.g., after payment, after maintenance request)
  - @Async for background processing
- Use Java/Spring services for:
  - Payment tracking and status updates
  - Maintenance request routing (simple rule-based)
  - User onboarding and registration flows
  - Generating and sending notifications (email/SMS via integrations)

## 2. Where to Add Agentic Patterns Later (Extension Points)
- If you need more advanced automation (AI/ML, LLMs, smart recommendations, or complex workflow orchestration):
  - Introduce Python microservices for:
    - LLM-powered chat or support
    - Smart property recommendations
    - Automated document analysis (leases, receipts)
    - Intelligent maintenance routing or escalation
  - Use REST APIs or message queues (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for integration between Spring and Python agents.
- Document event/message contracts for smooth cross-language communication.

## 3. Migration/Refactor Triggers
- Move to agentic/microservice model if:
  - Business logic becomes too complex for simple Spring services
  - You need to scale automation/AI independently
  - You want to leverage Python’s AI/ML ecosystem

## 4. Review Points
- Periodically review automation needs as platform grows
- Only add agentic/AI microservices when business value is clear
- Keep all architectural decisions and extension points documented in this roadmap

This roadmap is designed for rapid, maintainable growth—starting simple, but ready for advanced automation and agentic workflows as your needs evolve.
